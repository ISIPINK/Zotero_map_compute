This repository contains the computation for [Zotmap](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ISIPINK/zotmap). <br>

Zotmap is a visualization of my [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) library
by dimension reduction like [UMAP](https://github.com/lmcinnes/umap) in this case
[PaCMAP](https://github.com/lmcinnes/umap) on [SPECTER2](https://github.com/allenai/SPECTER2) embeddings of the title and abstract items in my library.
