We construct efﬁcient stochastic algorithms based on a probabilistic sampling of small size sub-matrices, or a randomized evaluation of a matrix-vector product and matrix iterations via a random sparsiﬁcation of the matrix. This approach is beyond the standard Markov chain based Neumann–Ulam method which has no universal instrument to decrease the variance. Instead, in the new method, ﬁrst, the variance can be decreased by increasing the number of the sampled columns of the matrix in play, and second, it is free of the restricted assumption of the Neumann–Ulam scheme that the Neumann series converges. We apply the developed methods to different stochastic iterative procedures. Application to boundary integral equation of the electrostatic potential theory is given where we develop a SRMC algorithm for solving the approximated system of linear algebraic equations, and compare it with the standard Random Walk on Boundary method.","2009-01","2022-09-17 17:35:35","2023-03-19 11:06:51","2022-09-17 17:35:35","","","3","15","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\isido\Zotero\storage\YBMLVR26\Sabelfeld en Mozartova - 2009 - Sparsified Randomization Algorithms for large syst.pdf","","linear systems; monte carlo","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is an old randomized procedure that results from using a random walk to stochastically evaluate terms in the Neumann series. In order to apply this procedure, the variance of the stochastic estimator needs to be bounded. The best known suﬃcient condition for bounding the variance is that the inﬁnity norm of the matrix in the Neumann series is smaller than one, which greatly limits the usability of this method. We improve this condition by proposing a new stochastic estimator based on a diﬀerent type of random walk. Our multiway walk and estimator is based on a time-inhomogeneous Markov process that iterates through a sequence of transition matrices built from the original linear system. For our new method, we prove that a necessary and suﬃcient condition for convergence is that the spectral radius of the elementwise absolute value of the matrix underlying the Neumann series is smaller than one. This is a strictly weaker condition than currently exists. In addition, our new method is often faster than the standard algorithm.

The fundamental idea is, during the Monte Carlo sampling process, the random walks generated to estimate one unknown element can also be effectively reused to estimate the other unknowns in the solution vector. As a result, when the random walks are reused, a single random walk can contribute samples for estimations of multiple unknowns in the solution simultaneously while ensuring that the samples for the same unknown element are statistically independent. Consequently, the total number of random walk transition steps needed for estimating the overall solution vector is reduced, which improves the performance of the Monte Carlo algorithm. We apply this approach to the Monte Carlo algorithm in two linear algebra applications, including solving a system of linear equations and approximating the inversion of a matrix. Our computational results show that compared to the conventional implementations of Monte Carlo algorithms for linear systems without random walk reusing, our approach can significantly improve the performance of Monte Carlo sampling process by reducing the overall number of transition steps in random walks to obtain the entire solution within desired precision.","2012","2022-09-17 17:35:48","2022-09-17 17:41:11","2022-09-17 17:35:48","383-392","","","9","","Procedia Computer Science","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\isido\Zotero\storage\G5YWGZPN\Ji en Li - 2012 - Reusing Random Walks in Monte Carlo Methods for Li.pdf","","linear systems; monte carlo","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study this method is adapted and developed for the ﬁrst time for the Brownian motion hitting times. The idea is to use the connexion between the δdimensional Bessel process and the δ-dimensional Brownian motion thanks to an explicit Bessel hitting time distribution associated with a particular curved boundary.

Modern geometric algorithms often need to solve Poisson-like equations on geometrically intricate domains. Conventional methods most often mesh the domain, which is both challenging and expensive for geometry with fine details or imperfections (holes, self-intersections, etc.). In contrast, gridfree Monte Carlo methods avoid mesh generation entirely, and instead just evaluate closest point queries. They hence do not discretize space, time, nor even function spaces, and provide the exact solution (in expectation) even on extremely challenging models. More broadly, they share many benefits with Monte Carlo methods from photorealistic rendering: excellent scaling, trivial parallel implementation, view-dependent evaluation, and the ability to work with any kind of geometry (including implicit or procedural descriptions). We develop a complete “black box” solver that encompasses integration, variance reduction, and visualization, and explore how it can be used for various geometry processing tasks. In particular, we consider several fundamental linear elliptic PDEs with constant coefficients on solid regions of Rn . Overall we find that Monte Carlo methods significantly broaden the horizons of geometry processing, since they easily handle problems of size and complexity that are essentially hopeless for conventional methods.","","2022-09-17 18:54:45","2023-08-03 18:36:47","","18","","4","38","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\isido\Zotero\storage\J5MXL5PE\Sawhney en Crane - Monte Carlo Geometry ProcessingA Grid-Free Approa.pdf","","monte carlo; PDE; rendering; walk on spheres","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One approach consists in pointing out explicit expressions of the probability distributions, an other approach is rather based on the numerical generation of the random variables. We propose an algorithm in order to generate the ﬁrst passage time through a given level of a one-dimensional jump diﬀusion. This process satisﬁes a stochastic diﬀerential equation driven by a Brownian motion and subject to random shocks characterized by an independent Poisson process. Our algorithm belongs to the family of rejection sampling procedures, also called exact simulation in this context: the outcome of the algorithm and the stopping time under consideration are identically distributed. It is based on both the exact simulation of the diﬀusion at a given time and on the exact simulation of ﬁrst passage time for continuous diﬀusions. It is therefore based on an extension of the algorithm introduced by Herrmann and Zucca [16] in the continuous framework. The challenge here is to generate the exact position of a continuous diﬀusion conditionally to the fact that the given level has not been reached before.

Speciﬁcally, we consider the Euler discretization approximation of Brownian motion to sample barrier-hitting events, i.e. hitting for the ﬁrst time a deterministic “barrier” function; and to sample extreme events, i.e. attaining a minimum on a given compact time interval or unbounded closed time interval. For each case we study the discretization error between the actual time the event occurs versus the time the event occurs for the discretized path, and also the discretization error on the position of the Brownian motion at these times. We show limits in distribution for the discretization errors normalized by their convergence rate, and give closed-form analytic expressions for the limiting random variables. Additionally, we use these limits to study the asymptotic behaviour of Gaussian random walks in the following situations: (1.) the overshoot of a Gaussian walk above a barrier that goes to inﬁnity; (2.) the minimum of a Gaussian walk compared to the minimum of the Brownian motion obtained when interpolating the Gaussian walk with Brownian bridges, both up to the same time horizon that goes to inﬁnity; and (3.) the global minimum of a Gaussian walk compared to the global minimum of the Brownian motion obtained when interpolating the Gaussian walk with Brownian bridges, when both have the same positive drift decreasing to zero. In deriving these limits in distribution we provide a uniﬁed framew√ork to understand the relation between several papers where the constant −ζ(1/2)/ 2π has appeared, where ζ is the Riemann zeta function. In particular, we show that this constant is the mean of some of the limiting distributions we derive.","2017-08-14","2022-12-08 15:19:28","2024-02-06 19:58:54","2022-12-08 15:19:28","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:1708.04356 [math]","","C:\Users\isido\Zotero\storage\BPSGSE6D\Dieker en Lagos - 2017 - On the Euler discretization error of Brownian moti.pdf","","first passage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:1708.04356","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The second approach approximates that integral using a Taylor series expansion. Both methods significantly reduce bias and speed convergence compared to the standard Monte Carlo simulation approach. For example, the first method achieves zero bias. In addition, it is about 100 times faster than the conventional Monte Carlo method that achieves acceptable bias.

A PDE solver finds the solution given coefficients and a boundary condition, whereas an inverse PDE solver goes the opposite way and reconstructs these inputs from an existing solution. In this article, we investigate techniques for solving inverse PDE problems using a gradient-based methodology. Conventional PDE solvers based on the finite element method require a domain meshing step that can be fragile and costly. Grid-free Monte Carlo methods instead stochastically sample paths using variations of the walk on spheres algorithm to construct an unbiased estimator of the solution. The uncanny similarity of these methods to physically-based rendering algorithms has been observed by several recent works. In the area of rendering, recent progress has led to the development of efficient unbiased derivative estimators. They solve an adjoint form of the problem and exploit arithmetic invertibility to compute gradients using a constant amount of memory and linear time complexity. Could these two lines of work be combined to compute cheap parametric derivatives of a grid-free PDE solver? We investigate this question and present preliminary results.

Additionally, it has been observed that there is always an optimal distance from the surface of the absorbing boundary, δI , for a GFFP algorithm within which a FP surface can be permitted to intersect the boundary [2–4]. In this paper, we will provide a rigorous complexity analysis consistent with these observations. This analysis is based on estimating the numbers of WOS and GFFP steps needed for absorption on the boundary, and the complexity and running times of each WOS and GFFP step.

"6S2E2MV5","journalArticle","","Drabeck, Florian","Monte Carlo Simulation of Boundary Crossing Probabilities for a Brownian Motion and Curved Boundaries","","","","","","We are concerned with the probability that a standard Brownian motion W (t) crosses a curved boundary c(t) on a  nite interval [0, T ]. Let this probability be denoted by Q(c(t); T ). Except for linear functions c(t) and a few other special cases no explicit, analytic formula for Q(c(t); T ) is available. Thus numerical methods need to be applied for general boundaries to obtain approximate solutions. Some authors use for example integral equations. However, most of these numerical methods are either intractable or di cult to asses in terms of their accuracy. Due to recent advances in research another way of estimating Q(c(t); T ) seems feasible: Monte Carlo Simulation. Wang and Pötzelberger (1997) derived an explicit formula for the boundary crossing probability of piecewise linear functions which has the form of an expectation. Based on this formula we proceed as follows: First we approximate the general boundary c(t) by a piecewise linear function cm(t) on a uniform partition 0 = t0 < t1... < tm = T . Then we simulate Brownian sample paths in order to evaluate the expectation in the formula of the authors for cm(t). The bias resulting when estimating Q(cm(t); T ) rather than Q(c(t); T ) can be bounded by a formula of Borovkov and Novikov (2005). Whereas the bias decreases at a rate of O(1/m2) for a partition rank m, the standard error due to Monte Carlo simulation only decays at a rate of O(1/√n), where n is the number of simulation cycles. Hence the standard deviation   or the variance respectively   is the main limiting factor when increasing the accuracy. The main goal of this dissertation is to  nd and evaluate variance reducing techniques in order to enhance the quality of the Monte Carlo estimator for Q(c(t); T ). Among the techniques we discuss are: • Antithetic Sampling, • Strati ed Sampling, • Importance Sampling, • Control Variates, • Transforming the original problem. We analyze each of these techniques thoroughly from a theoretical point of view. Further, we test each technique empirically through simulation experiments on several carefully chosen boundaries. In order to asses our results we set them in relation to a previously established benchmark. We are interested in the relative reduction in the mean squared error (= sum of the squared bias and variance) due to a given technique, where the computational e ort remains constant. As a result of this dissertation we derive some very potent techniques that yield a substantial improvement in terms of accuracy. We even discuss an approach that improves the rate at which our biased Monte Carlo estimator converges to the correct result.","","2022-12-20 11:47:54","2023-08-03 17:57:13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\isido\Zotero\storage\36MEIWXP\Drabeck - Monte Carlo Simulation of Boundary Crossing Probab.pdf","","first passage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Stanford University.","Robust Monte Carlo Methods for Light Transport Simulation.","","","","","Light transport algorithms generate realistic images by simulating the emission and scattering of light in an artificial environment. Applications include lighting design, architecture, and computer animation, while related engineering disciplines include neutron transport and radiative heat transfer. The main challenge with these algorithms is the high complexity of the geometric, scattering, and illumination models that are typically used. In this dissertation, we develop new Monte Carlo techniques that greatly extend the range of input models for which light transport simulations are practical. Our contributions include new theoretical models, statistical methods, and rendering algorithms. We start by developing a rigorous theoretical basis for bidirectional light transport algorithms (those that combine direct and adjoint techniques). First, we propose a linear operator formulation that does not depend on any assumptions about the physical validity of the input scene. We show how to obtain mathematically correct results using a variety of bidirectional techniques. Next we derive a different formulation, such that for any physically valid input scene, the transport operators are symmetric. This symmetry is important for both theory and implementations, and is based on a new reciprocity condition that we derive for transmissive materials. Finally, we show how light transport can be formulated as an integral over a space of paths. This framework allows new sampling and integration techniques to be applied, such as the Metropolis sampling algorithm. We also use this model to investigate the limitations of unbiased Monte Carlo methods, and to show that certain kinds of paths cannot be sampled. Our statistical contributions include a new technique called multiple importance sampling, which can greatly increase the robustness of Monte Carlo integration. It uses more than one sampling technique to evaluate an integral, and then combines these samples in a vi way that is provably close to optimal. This leads to estimators that have low variance for a broad class of integrands. We also describe a new variance reduction technique called efficiency-optimized Russian roulette. Finally, we link these ideas together to obtain new Monte Carlo light transport algorithms. Bidirectional path tracing uses a family of different path sampling techniques that generate some path vertices starting from a light source, and some starting from a sensor. We show that when these techniques are combined using multiple importance sampling, a large range of difficult lighting effects can be handled efficiently. The algorithm is unbiased, handles arbitrary geometry and materials, and is relatively simple to implement. The second algorithm we describe is Metropolis light transport, inspired by the Metropolis sampling method from computational physics. Paths are generated by following a random walk through path space, such that the probability density of visiting each path is proportional to the contribution it makes to the ideal image. The resulting algorithm is unbiased, uses little storage, handles arbitrary geometry and materials, and can be orders of magnitude more efficient than previous unbiased approaches. It performs especially well on problems that are usually considered difficult, e.g. those involving bright indirect light, small geometric holes, or glossy surfaces. To our knowledge, this is the first application of the Metropolis method to transport problems of any kind.","1997","2022-12-23 16:13:42","2023-08-03 17:56:34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\isido\Zotero\storage\HDZ56Y9U\Veach - 1997 - Robust Monte Carlo Methods for Light Transport Sim.pdf","","importance sampling; monte carlo; rendering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There exists an alternative interpretation in calculus where Monte Carlo integration can be seen as estimating a \emph{constant} function -- from the stochastic evaluations of the integrand -- that integrates to the original integral. The integral mean value theorem states that this \emph{constant} function should be the mean (or expectation) of the integrand. Since both interpretations result in the same estimator, little attention has been devoted to the calculus-oriented interpretation. We show that the calculus-oriented interpretation actually implies the possibility of using a more \emph{complex} function than a \emph{constant} one to construct a more efficient estimator for Monte Carlo integration. We build a new estimator based on this interpretation and relate our estimator to control variates with least-squares regression on the stochastic samples of the integrand. Unlike prior work, our resulting estimator is \emph{provably} better than or equal to the conventional Monte Carlo estimator. To demonstrate the strength of our approach, we introduce a practical estimator that can act as a simple drop-in replacement for conventional Monte Carlo integration.

In this paper we developed a τ -leaping method for computing the FPT and position in arbitrary volumes for a Brownian particle governed by the Langevin equation. The τ -leaping method proposed here works as follows. A sphere is inscribed within the volume of interest (VOI) centered at the initial particle’s location. On this sphere, the FPT is sampled, as well as the position, which becomes the new initial position. Then, another sphere, centered at this new location, is inscribed. This process continues until the sphere becomes smaller than some minimal radius Rmin. When this occurs, the τ -leaping switches to the conventional Monte Carlo, which runs until the particle either crosses the surface of the VOI or ﬁnds its way to a position where a sphere of radius > Rmin can be inscribed. The switching between τ -leaping and MC continues until the particle crosses the surface of the VOI. The purpose of a minimal radius is to avoid having to sample the velocities, which become irrelevant when the particle diﬀuses beyond a certain distance, i. e. Rmin The size of this radius depends on the system parameters and on one’s notion of accuracy: the larger this radius the more accurate the τ -leaping method, but also less eﬃcient. This trade oﬀ between accuracy and eﬃciency is discussed. For two VOI, the τ -leaping method is shown to be accurate and more eﬃcient than MC by at least a factor of 10 and up to a factor of about 110. However, while MC becomes exponentially slower with increasing VOI, the eﬃciency of the τ -leaping method remains relatively unchanged. Thus, the τ -leaping method can potentially be many orders of magnitude more eﬃcient than MC.","2023-01-02","2023-01-05 21:32:56","2024-02-06 20:07:49","2023-01-05 21:32:56","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2301.00647 [cond-mat, q-bio]","","C:\Users\isido\Zotero\storage\J5YXETE7\Albert - 2023 - A tau-leaping method for computing joint probabili.pdf","","first passage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2301.00647","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We also propose to leverage a neural importance sampler to estimate the difference between the original integrand and the learned control variate. To optimize the resulting parametric estimator, we derive a theoretically optimal, variance-minimizing loss function, and propose an alternative, composite loss for stable online training in practice.

RSAs use randomization to eﬃciently compute expectations, and so their iterates form a stochastic process. The key idea of our analysis is to lift the RSA into an appropriate higher-dimensional space and then express it as an equivalent Markov chain. Instead of determining the convergence of this Markov chain (which may not converge under constant stepsize), we study the convergence of the distribution of this Markov chain. To study this, we deﬁne a new notion of Wasserstein divergence. We show that if the distribution of the iterates in the Markov chain satisfy a contraction property with respect to the Wasserstein divergence, then the Markov chain admits an invariant distribution. We show that convergence of a large family of constant stepsize RSAs can be understood using this framework, and we provide several detailed examples.","2021-01-05","2023-01-11 14:08:41","2024-02-07 16:13:54","2023-01-11 14:08:41","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2003.11403 [cs, eess, math, stat]","","C:\Users\isido\Zotero\storage\IAT28HNB\Gupta en Haskell - 2021 - Convergence of Recursive Stochastic Algorithms usi.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2003.11403","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our               decomposition tracking               accelerates free-path construction by splitting the medium into a control component and a residual component and sampling each of them separately. To minimize expensive evaluations of spatially varying collision coefficients, we define the control component to allow constructing free paths in closed form. The residual heterogeneous component is then homogenized by adding a fictitious medium and handled using weighted delta tracking, which removes the need for computing strict bounds of the extinction function. Our second contribution,               spectral tracking               , enables efficient light transport simulation in chromatic media.

However, standard methods do not allow the distribution of the particles to evolve during the algorithm, as is the case in sequential simulation methods. Within the standard adaptive importance sampling framework, a simple weighted least squares approach is proposed to improve the procedure with control variates. The procedure takes the form of a quadrature rule with adapted quadrature weights to reﬂect the information brought in by the control variates. The quadrature points and weights do not depend on the integrand, a computational advantage in case of multiple integrands. Moreover, the target density needs to be known only up to a multiplicative constant. Our main result is a non-asymptotic bound on the probabilistic error of the procedure. The bound proves that for improving the estimate’s accuracy, the beneﬁts from adaptive importance sampling and control variates can be combined.

Firstly, a quick overview of previously obtained results from applying the approach towards the Fredholm-type integral equations is made. In the main part of the paper, the method is applied towards a linear ODE system that is transformed into an equivalent system of the Volterra-type integral equations, which makes it possible to remove the limitations due to the conditions of convergence of the majorant series. The following key theorems are stated. Theorem 1 provides the necessary compliance conditions that should be imposed upon the transition propability and initial distribution densities that initiate the corresponding Markov chain, for which equality between the mathematical expectation of the estimate and the functional of interest would hold. Theorem 2 formulates the equation that governs the estimate’s variance. Theorem 3 states the Markov chain parameters that minimize the variance of the estimate of the functional. Proofs are given for all three theorems. In the practical part of this paper, the proposed method is used to solve a linear ODE system that describes a closed queueing system of ten conventional machines and seven conventional service persons.

In many financial models such prices can be approximated by means of Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. To obtain a good approximation the MC sample size usually needs to be considerably large resulting in a long computing time to obtain a single approximation. In this paper we introduce a new approximation strategy for parametric approximation problems including the parametric financial pricing problems described above. A central aspect of the approximation strategy proposed in this article is to combine MC algorithms with machine learning techniques to, roughly speaking, learn the random variables (LRV) in MC simulations. In other words, we employ stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization methods not to train parameters of standard artificial neural networks (ANNs) but to learn random variables appearing in MC approximations. We numerically test the LRV strategy on various parametric problems with convincing results when compared with standard MC simulations, Quasi-Monte Carlo simulations, SGD-trained shallow ANNs, and SGD-trained deep ANNs. Our numerical simulations strongly indicate that the LRV strategy might be capable to overcome the curse of dimensionality in the $L^\infty$-norm in several cases where the standard deep learning approach has been proven not to be able to do so. This is not a contradiction to lower bounds established in the scientific literature because this new LRV strategy is outside of the class of algorithms for which lower bounds have been established in the scientific literature. The proposed LRV strategy is of general nature and not only restricted to the parametric financial pricing problems described above, but applicable to a large class of approximation problems.","2022-02-06","2023-01-24 16:21:57","2024-02-09 18:20:17","2023-01-24 16:21:57","","","","","","","Learning the random variables in Monte Carlo simulations with stochastic gradient descent","","","","","arXiv","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2202.02717 [cs, math]","","C:\Users\isido\Zotero\storage\ZT28NZYQ\Becker e.a. - 2022 - Learning the random variables in Monte Carlo simul.pdf","","machine learning; monte carlo; optimization; PDE; SGD","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2202.02717","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"NEHW9EQA","journalArticle","","Giles, Mike","Smoking adjoints, part II: fast Monte Carlo Greeks","","","","","","The efficient calculation of price sensitivities continues to be among the greatest practical challenges facing users of Monte Carlo methods in the derivatives industry. Computing Greeks is essential to hedging and risk management, but typically requires substantially more computing time than pricing a derivative. This article shows how an adjoint formula- tion can be used to accelerate the calculation of the Greeks. This method is particularly well suited to applications requiring sensitivities to a large number of parameters. Examples include interest rate derivatives requir- ing sensitivities to all initial forward rates and equity derivatives requiring sensitivities to all points on a volatility surface. The simplest methods for estimating Greeks are based on finite differ- ence approximations, in which a Monte Carlo pricing routine is rerun mul- tiple times at different settings of the input parameters in order to estimate sensitivities to the parameters. In the fixed-income setting, for example, this would mean perturbing each initial forward rate and then rerunning the Monte Carlo simulation to re-price a security or a whole book. The main virtues of this method are that it is straightforward to understand and requires no additional programming. But the bias and variance properties of finite difference estimates can be rather poor, and their computing time requirements grow with the number of input parameters. Better estimates of price sensitivities can often be derived by using in- formation about model dynamics in a Monte Carlo simulation. Techniques for doing this include the pathwise method and likelihood ratio method, both of which are reviewed in chapter 7 of Glasserman (2004). When ap- plicable, these methods produce unbiased estimates of price sensitivities from a single set of simulated paths, that is, without perturbing any para- meters. The pathwise method accomplishes this by differentiating the evo- lution of the underlying assets or state variables along each path; the likelihood ratio method instead differentiates the transition density of the underlying assets or state variables. In comparison with finite difference estimates, these methods require additional model analysis and program- ming, but the additional effort is often justified by the improvement in the quality of calculated Greeks. The adjoint method we develop here applies ideas used in computa- tional fluid dynamics (Giles & Pierce, 2000) to the calculation of pathwise estimates of Greeks. The estimate calculated using the adjoint method is identical to the ordinary pathwise estimate; its potential advantage is there- fore computational, rather than statistical. The relative merits of the ordi- nary (forward) calculation of pathwise Greeks and the adjoint calculation can be summarised as follows: a) the adjoint method is advantageous for calculating the sensitivities of a small number of securities with respect to a large number of parameters; and b) the forward method is advantageous for calculating the sensitivities of many securities with respect to a small number of parameters. The ‘small number of securities’ in this dichotomy could be an entire book, consisting of many individual securities, so long as the sensitivities to be calculated are for the book as a whole and not for the constituent securities. The rest of this article is organised as follows. The next section reviews the usual forward calculation of pathwise Greeks and the subsequent sec- tion illustrates its application in the Libor market model. We then develop the adjoint method for delta estimates, and extend it to applications such as vega estimation requiring sensitivities to parameters of model dynam- ics, rather than just sensitivities to initial conditions. We then extend it to gamma estimation. We use the Libor market model as an illustrative ex- ample in both settings. Lastly, we present numerical results that illustrate the computational savings offered by the adjoint method.","","2023-01-30 16:57:01","2023-08-03 17:46:28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\isido\Zotero\storage\D4MR342G\Giles - Smoking adjoints, part II fast Monte Carlo Greeks.pdf","","greeks; monte carlo","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"GQMNHDI6","journalArticle","","Trefethen, Lloyd N","Approximation Theory and Approximation Practice","","","","","","There are quite a number of excellent books on approximation theory. Three classics are [Cheney 1966], [Davis 1975], and [Meinardus 1967], and a slightly more recent computationally oriented classic is [Powell 1981]. Perhaps the first approximation theory text was [Borel 1905]. A good deal of my emphasis will be on ideas related to Chebyshev points and polynomials, whose origins go back more than a century to mathematicians including Chebyshev (1821–1894), de la Valle  ́e Poussin (1866–1962), Bernstein (1880–1968), and Jackson (1888–1946). In the computer era, some of the early figures who developed “Chebyshev technology,” in approximately chronological order, were Lanczos, Clenshaw, Good, Fox, Elliott, Mason, Orszag, Paszkowski, and V. I. Lebedev. Five books on Chebyshev polynomials are by Snyder [1966], Paszkowski [1975], Fox and Parker [1968], Rivlin [1990], and Mason and Handscomb [2003]. One reason we emphasize Chebyshev technology so much is that in practice, for working with functions on intervals, these methods are unbeatable. For example, we shall see in Chapter 16 that the difference in approximation power between Chebyshev and “optimal” interpolation points is utterly negligible. Another reason is that if you know the Chebyshev material well, this is the best possible foundation for work on other approximation topics, and for understanding the links with Fourier analysis.","","2023-01-30 18:24:38","2023-08-11 18:50:10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\isido\Zotero\storage\MREQLLLP\Trefethen - Approximation Theory and Approximation Practice.pdf","","chebychev; integration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Historically, the MC method has not been applied successfully to the solution of wave problems. This can primarily be attributed to the problem of resonance in the frequency-domain Green’s function for finite geometries at length scales greater than half a wavelength. In our previously published work, we have been successful in obtaining a frequency-domain solution at multiple-wavelength length scales through the use of infinite-domain Green’s functions. In this work, we extend the algorithm to problems in the time-domain. The MC method does not require any discretization, and hence the memory requirements are lower than approaches based on discretization. Another advantage of the MC method is that the computational procedure is inherently parallelizable and an almost linear increase in computational speed can be obtained with an increase in the number of processors. The application area of our interest is in the full-wave analysis of IC interconnect structures at multi-GHz frequencies.","","2023-02-09 08:59:19","2024-02-07 20:09:59","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\isido\Zotero\storage\Z59LHDC5\Chatterjee en Yu - A Monte Carlo Algorithm for the Solution of the On.pdf","","monte carlo; PDE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To address this issue, importance sampling can be employed to drive down the sampling error to a desirable level. However, selecting a good importance sampler requires knowledge of the solution to the problem at hand, which is the goal to begin with and thus forms a circular challenge. We investigate the use of adaptive importance sampling to untie this circularity. Our procedure sequentially updates the importance sampler to reach the optimal sampler and the optimal solution simultaneously, and can be embedded in both sample average approximation and stochastic approximation-type algorithms.

MIS requires that the techniques’ probability density functions (PDFs) are readily evaluable point-wise. However, this requirement may not be satisfied when (some of) those PDFs are marginals, i.e., integrals of other PDFs. We generalize MIS to combine samples from such marginal PDFs. The key idea is to consider each marginalization domain as a continuous space of sampling techniques with readily evaluable (conditional) PDFs. We stochastically select techniques from these spaces and combine the samples drawn from them into an unbiased estimator. Prior work has dealt with the special cases of multiple classical techniques or a single marginal one. Our formulation can handle mixtures of those. We apply our marginal MIS formulation to light-transport simulation to demonstrate its utility. We devise a marginal path sampling framework that makes previously intractable sampling techniques practical and significantly broadens the path-sampling choices beyond what is presently possible. We highlight results from two algorithms based on marginal MIS: a novel formulation of path-space filtering at multiple vertices along a camera path and a similar filtering method for photon-density estimation.

We then recover the high-frequency details missed by the control variate by using Monte Carlo integration of the residual. Our work leverages importance sampling techniques by working in primary space, allowing the combination of multiple mappings; this enables multiple importance sampling in quadrature-based integration. Our algorithm is generic, and can be applied to any complex multidimensional integral. We demonstrate its effectiveness with four applications with low dimensionality: transmittance estimation in heterogeneous participating media, low-order scattering in homogeneous media, direct illumination computation, and rendering of distributed effects.

Instead, most previous work pursues the zero-variance goal: The local decisions are guided under the assumption that all other decisions along the random walk will be sampled perfectly. In practice, however, many decisions are poorly guided, or not guided at all. Furthermore, learned distributions are often marginalized, e.g., by neglecting the BSDF.

Most applications in this area jointly optimize a large set of scene parameters to minimize an objective function, in which case reverse-mode differentiation is the method of choice for obtaining parameter gradients.             However, existing techniques that perform the necessary differentiation step suffer from either statistical bias or a prohibitive cost in terms of memory and computation time. For example, standard techniques for automatic differentiation based on program transformation or Wengert tapes lead to impracticably large memory usage when applied to physically-based rendering algorithms. A recently proposed adjoint method by Nimier-David et al. [2020] reduces this to a constant memory footprint, but the computation time for unbiased gradient estimates then becomes quadratic in the number of scattering events along a light path. This is problematic when the scene contains highly scattering materials like participating media.             In this paper, we propose a new unbiased backpropagation algorithm for rendering that only requires constant memory, and whose computation time is linear in the number of scattering events (i.e., just like path tracing). Our approach builds on the invertibility of the local Jacobian at scattering interactions to recover the various quantities needed for reverse-mode differentiation.

Nested expectations appear, for example, in the numerical approximation of solutions of backward stochastic diﬀerential equations (BSDEs), in the numerical approximation of solutions of semilinear parabolic partial diﬀerential equations (PDEs), in statistical physics, in optimal stopping problems such as the approximative pricing of American or Bermudan options, in risk measure estimation in mathematical ﬁnance, or in decisionmaking under uncertainty. Nested expectations which arise in the above named applications often consist of a large number of nestings. However, the computational eﬀort of standard nested Monte Carlo approximations for iterated nested expectations grows exponentially in the number of nestings and it remained an open question whether it is possible to approximately calculate multiply iterated high-dimensional nested expectations in polynomial time. In this article we tackle this problem by proposing and studying a new class of full-history recursive multilevel Picard (MLP) approximation schemes for iterated nested expectations. In particular, we prove under suitable assumptions that these MLP approximation schemes can approximately calculate multiply iterated nested expectations with a computational effort growing at most polynomially in the number of nestings K P N “ t1, 2, 3, . . .u, in the problem dimension d P N, and in the reciprocal 1{ε of the desired approximation accuracy ε P p0, 8q.","2020-09-29","2023-02-18 14:08:24","2024-02-07 20:14:09","2023-02-18 14:08:24","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2009.13989 [cs, math]","","C:\Users\isido\Zotero\storage\DERMR4VB\Beck e.a. - 2020 - Nonlinear Monte Carlo methods with polynomial runt.pdf","","monte carlo","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2009.13989","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The available algorithms enabling such decompositions present severe eﬃciency limitations and are an obstacle for the solution of large scale and high dimensional problems. Our main contribution is the improvement of the parallel eﬃciency of the parareal in time method. The parareal method is based on combining predictions made by a numerically inexpensive solver (with coarse physics and/or coarse resolution) with corrections coming from an expensive solver (with highﬁdelity physics and high resolution). At convergence, the algorithm provides a solution that has the ﬁne solver’s high-ﬁdelity physics and high resolution. In the classical version, the ﬁne solver has a ﬁxed high accuracy which is the major obstacle to achieve a competitive parallel eﬃciency. In this paper, we develop an adaptive variant that overcomes this obstacle by dynamically increasing the accuracy of the ﬁne solver across the parareal iterations. We theoretically show that the parallel eﬃciency becomes very competitive in the ideal case where the cost of the coarse solver is small, thus proving that the only remaining factors impeding full scalability become the cost of the coarse solver and communication time. The developed theory has also the merit of setting a general framework to understand the success of several extensions of parareal based on iteratively improving the quality of the ﬁne solver and re-using information from previous parareal steps. We illustrate the actual performance of the method in stiﬀ ODEs, which are a challenging family of problems since the only mechanism for adaptivity is time and eﬃciency is aﬀected by the cost of the coarse solver.","2020-03-26","2023-02-25 20:14:10","2024-02-07 20:14:58","2023-02-25 20:14:10","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:1909.08333 [cs, math]","","C:\Users\isido\Zotero\storage\3JZWT34D\Maday en Mula - 2020 - An Adaptive Parareal Algorithm.pdf","","ODE; parareal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:1909.08333","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It extends the analog computing techniques to a new paradigm: continuous-time hybrid computation, where both analog and digital circuits operate in continuous time. In this approach, the time intervals in the digital signals contain important information. Unlike conventional synchronous digital circuits, continuous-time digital signals offer the benefits of adaptive power dissipation and no quantization noise. Two prototype chips have been fabricated in 65 nm CMOS technology and tested successfully. The first chip is capable of solving nonlinear differential equations up to 4th order, and the second chip scales up to 16th order based on the first chip. Nonlinear functions are generated by a programmable, clockless, continuous-time 8-bit hybrid architecture (ADC+SRAM+DAC). Digitally-assisted calibration is used in all analog/mixed-signal blocks. Compared to the prior art [1], our chips makes possible arbitrary nonlinearities and achieves 16× lower power dissipation, thanks to technology scaling and extensive use of class-AB analog blocks Typically, the unit achieves a computational accuracy of about 0.5% to 5% RMS, solution times from a fraction of 1 μs to several hundred μs, and total computational energy from a fraction of 1 nJ to hundreds of nJ, depending on equation details. Very significant advantages are observed in computational speed and energy (over two orders of magnitude and over one order of magnitude, respectively) compared to those obtained with a modern MSP430 microcontroller for the same RMS error.","","2023-03-01 20:15:03","2023-08-01 13:56:51","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\isido\Zotero\storage\DZW3H37R\Guo - Investigation of Energy-Efficient Hybrid AnalogDi.pdf","","analog; ODE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this function space, the optimal rate for the worst-case root-mean-squared error (RMSE) is established. Here, optimality is for a general class of quadratures, in which adaptive non-linear algorithms with a possibly varying number of function evaluations are also allowed. The optimal rate is given by showing matching bounds. First, a lower bound on the worst-case RMSE of O(n−α−1/2) is proven, where n denotes an upper bound on the expected number of function evaluations. It turns out that a suitably randomized trapezoidal rule attains this rate, up to a logarithmic factor. A practical error estimator for this trapezoidal rule is also presented. Numerical results support our theory.","2022-12-21","2023-03-06 09:27:13","2024-02-07 20:16:18","2023-03-06 09:27:13","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2212.11476 [cs, math]","","C:\Users\isido\Zotero\storage\E7GZXZDN\Goda e.a. - 2022 - Randomizing the trapezoidal rule gives the optimal.pdf","","integration; IBC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2212.11476","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is constructed from the Pad´e expansions of the matrix exponential solution of a system of ﬁrst-order ordinary diﬀerential equations formulated in the state-space. A computationally eﬃcient scheme is developed exploiting the techniques of polynomial factorization and partial fractions of rational functions, and by decoupling the solution for the displacement and velocity vectors. An important feature of the novel algorithm is that no direct inversion of the mass matrix is required. From the diagonal Pad´e expansion of order M a time-stepping scheme of order 2M is developed. Here, each elevation of the accuracy by two orders results in an additional system of real or complex sparse equations to be solved. These systems are comparable in complexity to the standard Newmark method, i.e., the eﬀective system matrix is a linear combination of the static stiﬀness, damping, and mass matrices. It is shown that the second-order scheme is equivalent to Newmark’s constant average acceleration method, often also referred to as trapezoidal rule. The proposed time integrator has been implemented in MATLAB using the built-in direct linear equation solvers. In this article, numerical examples featuring nearly one million degrees of freedom are presented. High-accuracy and eﬃciency in comparison with common second-order time integration schemes are observed.

The algorithm is based on rank-$1$ lattice rules with a random number of points~$n$. For the case $\alpha>1/2$, we prove that the algorithm achieves almost the optimal order of convergence of $\mathcal{O}(n^{-\alpha-1/2})$, where the implied constant is independent of the dimension~$d$ if the weights satisfy $\sum_{j=1}^\infty \gamma_j^{1/\alpha}<\infty$. The same rate of convergence holds for the more general case $\alpha>0$ by adding a random shift to the lattice rule with random $n$. This shows, in particular, that the exponent of strong tractability in the randomized setting equals $1/(\alpha+1/2)$, if the weights decay fast enough. We obtain a lower bound to indicate that our results are essentially optimal. This paper is a significant advancement over previous related works with respect to the potential for implementation and the independence of error bounds on the problem dimension. Other known algorithms which achieve the optimal error bounds, such as those based on Frolov's method, are very difficult to implement especially in high dimensions. Here we adapt a lesser-known randomization technique introduced by Bakhvalov in 1961.

As in any overview book, several topics are covered only quite briefly. My aim was to focus on topics that seem to be less available in introductory form. However, I try to give a global view of the subject by covering a broad spectrum of ideas and tools. The detailed bibliography aims to direct the reader to further topics. To explain it with a simple metaphor: using this book should make you more familiar with a country’s map, culture, and main attractions rather than imparting details of every street in just one city. Both things are useful at times. The term “multiple time scale dynamics” is rather modern. The subject and many of its core ideas are much older. For example, “singular perturbation theory” or “multiscale systems” encompass a larger variety of topics than what I present here. On the one hand, no serious multidimensional spatial problems are considered in this book. Furthermore, there are many singularly perturbed problems that have very little to do with dynamical systems. On the other hand, ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with multiple time scales already contain motivation, technique, and intuition for more complicated scenarios. Classical singular perturbation theory for multiple time scale systems provides many asymptotic techniques centered on series expansions, matching, and averaging. These methods are still indispensable today, and this book gives an overview of them. However, the details are not covered, since many excellent introductory texts are available. The last two decades have brought major additional progress with a particular focus on geometric ideas as well as powerful numerical algorithms. A major goal of this book was to merge several viewpoints with a wide variety of different techniques into a unified framework. Another reason for the broad choice of topics was to make it easier for students and researchers new to the field to get a much quicker overview. Again, I would like to warn the reader that this book is obviously not a mathematical monograph aiming at a complete treatment of the entire field of multiple time scales. Some readers, particularly students, may wonder how a book of over 700 pages can be only an “introduction,” but let me point out that most chapters, and even many five-page sections, in this book in fact deserve their own mathematical monograph of 300 pages or more. A few such books have vi PREFACE been written, while many exist only in a distant, happier future. I encourage my colleagues working in the field—you know who you are—to begin work on such projects and fill in the missing mathematical details that I decided to leave out in order to make the subject much more accessible to beginners. Despite the simplifications, there seem to be several advantages of the style of presentation. The great diversity of the subject, ranging from mathematical theory in dynamics, analysis, geometry, topology, stochastics, and numerics to virtually all fields in science and engineering applications, easily becomes visible. The unity and interconnections between different approaches to multiple time scale problems can be identified much more readily. Also, scientists with particular applications in mind should find it easier to spot many potential tools right away, while a “purer” mathematician can use this text as a source book of open mathematical problems. The target audience of the book is senior undergraduates, graduate students, as well as researchers interested in using the theory of multiple time scale dynamics in nonlinear science, either from a theoretical or a mathematical modeling perspective. Section 1.1provides a more detailed guide to the book. Now I have the pleasure of thanking several colleagues, collaborators, and institutions that have helped to get this book started, keep it on track, and eventually push it over the finish line. First and foremost, I would like to thank my thesis adviser, John Guckenheimer, for introducing me to the field during my time as a graduate student. Undoubtedly, he shaped my view of the field, and without his support and encouragement, I would never have attempted to undertake a book project on multiple time scale systems. Important influences on this book during my postdoctoral years have come from my colleagues Thilo Gross, Peter Szmolyan, Nils Berglund, and Barbara Gentz. Thilo helped me to form bridges from multiscale dynamics to such seemingly distant areas as ecology, networks, systems biology, and statistical physics. I would like to thank Peter for sharing his tremendous insights into all aspects of geometric multiscale dynamics. Nils and Barbara have been constant sources of inspiration on everything stochastic. Although it is clear that I am responsible for all potential errors that may remain within this version, I would like to thank several colleagues who responded with valuable feedback—alerting me to anything from tiny typos to blatant blunders—in various draft versions of this book: Nils Berglund, Alan Champneys, Hayato Chiba, Mike Cortez, Peter De Maesschalck, John Guckenheimer, Pavel Gurevich, Annalisa Iuorio, Mike Jeffrey, Hans Kaper, Daniel Karrasch, Chris Jones, Ilona Kosiuk, Steven Lade, Gabriel Lord, Anatoly Neishtadt, Clare Perryman, Sofia Piltz, Nikola Popovic, Jens Rademacher, Martin Rasmussen, Martin Riedler, Stephen Schecter, Jan Sieber, Eric Siero, Peter Szmolyan, Frits Veerman, Martin Wechselberger, and Antonios Zagaris. Furthermore, I would like to thank the production staff at Springer for the handling of my manuscript. In particular, Achi Dosanjh has been extremely important and tremendously helpful in leading the entire editorial process. Regarding the formatting of the book, I would also like to thank Yuri Kuznetsov PREFACE vii who shared his LATEX book formatting preamble with me, from which I took some inspiration for the format of this book. Several anonymous referees also provided very valuable feedback, which helped to improve the book. During the writing of this book I have also benefited from the generous hospitality and financial support of various institutions, including Cornell University, the Max Planck Institute for Physics of Complex Systems, and the Vienna University of Technology. Furthermore, I would like to thank the Austrian Academy of Sciences for support via the “Austrian Programme for Advanced Research and Technology” and the European Commission for support via a “Marie Curie International Reintegration Grant.” The final push of this project has been supported through the program “Oberwolfach Leibniz Fellows” by the Mathematisches Forschungsinstitut Oberwolfach. Although it is obvious for an overview book on a topic, let me stress that I do not make any claims to novelty of its content. I have tried to summarize and condense the extensive literature on multiple time scale dynamics into a more accessible expository format. However, I can certainly say that during the writing of this book, several very natural new ideas arose. I hope that the research-oriented reader will have a similar experience and that this book will provide a starting point for new ideas in multiscale dynamics.","2015","2023-03-08 14:04:36","2023-08-01 13:48:59","2023-03-08 14:04:36","","","","191","","","","Applied Mathematical Sciences","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-12316-5","","C:\Users\isido\Zotero\storage\KEKJNI5S\Kuehn - 2015 - Multiple Time Scale Dynamics.pdf","","perturbation techniques","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"SED9FB9T","document","","","intro perturbation theory","","","","","","First, let me say hello and welcome to the subject of perturbation methods. For those who may be unfamiliar with the topic, the title can be confusing. The first time I became aware of this was during a family reunion when someone asked what I did as a mathematician. This is not an easy question to answer, but I started by describing how a certain segment of the applied mathematics community was interested in problems that arise from physical problems. Examples such as water waves, sound propagation, and the aerodynamics of airplanes were discussed. The difficulty of solving such problems was also described in exaggerated detail. Next came the part about how one generally ends up using a computer to actually find the solution. At this point I editorialized on the limitations of computer solutions and why it is important to derive, if at all possible, accurate approximations of the solution. This lead naturally to the mentioning of asymptotics and perturbation methods. These terms ended the conversation because I was unprepared for their reactions. They were not sure exactly what asymptotics meant, but they were quite perplexed about perturbation methods. I tried, unsuccessfully, to explain what it means, but it was not until sometime later that I realized the difficulty. For them, as in Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, the first two meanings for the word perturb are ""to disturb greatly in mind (disquiet); to throw into confusion (disorder)."" Although a cynic might suggest this is indeed appropriate for the subject, the intent is exactly the opposite. (For a related comment, see Exercise 3.4.1(d).) In a nutshell, this book serves as an introduction into how to systematically construct an approximation of the solution of a problem that i viii Preface otherwise intractable. The methods all rely on there being a parameter in the problem that is relatively small. Such a situation is relatively common in applications, and this is one of the reasons that perturbation methods are a cornerstone of applied mathematics. One of the other cornerstones is scientific computing, and it is interesting that the two subjects have grown up together. However, this is not unexpected given their respective capabilities. When using a computer, one is capable of solving problems that are nonlinear, inhomogeneous, and multidimensional. Moreover, it is possible to achieve very high accuracy. The drawbacks are that computer solutions do not provide much insight into the physics of the problem (particularly for those who do not have access to the appropriate software or computer), and there is always the question as to whether or not the computed solution is correct. On the other hand, perturbation methods are also capable of dealing with nonlinear, inhomogeneous, and multidimensional problems (although not to the same extent as computer-generated solutions). The principal objective when using perturbation methods, at least as far as the author is concerned, is to provide a reasonably accurate expression for the solution. By doing this one is able to derive an understanding of the physics of the problem. Also, one can use the result, in conjunction with the original problem, to obtain more efficient numerical procedures for computing the solution. The methods covered in the text vary widely in their applicability. The first chapter introduces the fundamental ideas underlying asymptotic approximations. This includes their use in constructing approximate solutions of transcendental equations as well as differential equations. In the second chapter, matched asymptotic expansions are used to analyze problems with layers. Chapter 3 describes a method for dealing with problems with more than one time scale. In Chapter 4, the WKB method for analyzing linear singular perturbation problems is developed, while in Chapter 5 a method for dealing with materials containing disparate spatial scales (e.g., microscopic versus macroscopic) is discussed. The last chapter examines the topics of multiple solutions and stability. The mathematical prerequisites for this text include a basic background in differential equations and advanced calculus. In terms of difficulty, the chapters are written so that the first sections are either elementary or intermediate, while the later sections are somewhat more advanced. Also, the ideas developed in each chapter are applied to a spectrum of problems, including ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, and difference equations. Scattered through the exercises are applications to integral equations, integra-differential equations, differential-difference equations, and delay equations. What will not be found is an in-depth discussion of the theory underlying the methods. This aspect of the subject is important, and references to the more theoretical work in the area are given in each chapter Preface ix The exercises in each section vary in their complexity. In addition to the more standard textbook problems, an attempt has been made to include problems from the research literature. The latter are intended to provide a window into the wide range of areas that use perturbation methods. Solutions to some of the exercises are available from the author's home page located at http://www.math.rpi.edu/""'holmes. Also located there is an errata list. Those who may want to make a contribution to one of these files, or have suggestions about the text, can reach the author at holmes@rpi.edu. I would like to express my gratitude to the many students who took my course in perturbation methods at Rensselaer. They helped me immeasurably in understanding the subject and provided much needed encouragement to write this book. It is a pleasure to acknowledge the suggestions of Jon Bell, Ash Kapila, and Bob O'Malley, who read early versions of the manuscript. I would also like to thank Julian Cole, who first introduced me to perturbation methods and is still, to this day, showing me what the subject is about.","","2023-03-08 17:07:46","2023-08-01 13:47:31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\isido\Zotero\storage\A7D8KXBJ\[Texts in Applied Mathematics №20] Mark H.

As graphs are a particular favorite topic of mine I took on this challenge with zeal and alacrity. In our ensuing sessions we touched upon some interesting topics regarding recursion, which inspired me to write this article. I assume you, dear reader, are already somewhat familiar with recursion. Nevertheless, I begin this article with a brief recap of a classic recursive solution: calculating a factorial. Then I introduce the what and why of tail recursion and how to modify regular recursion to tail recursion. The meat of this article is a discussion of how to use regular recursion and tail recursion to solve branching problems. The particular branching problem I use as an example is finding paths in a tree. I discuss not one but two different approaches to finding paths in trees. The first is more flexible, the second is more performant.","2022-02-16","2023-03-15 10:54:40","2023-08-01 13:46:26","2023-03-15 10:54:40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Section: post","","C:\Users\isido\Zotero\storage\4BTFZQHH\recursion-1.html","","tail recursion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

No previous knowledge about the subject was assumed, but the presentation is based on some background in measure theory. There are several reasons why one should learn more about stochastic differential equations: They have a wide range of applications outside mathematics, there are many fruitful connections to other mathematical disciplines and the subject has a rapidly developing life of its own as a fascinating research field with many interesting unanswered questions. Unfortunately most of the literature about stochastic differential equations seems to place so much emphasis on rigor and completenessthatitscares many nonexperts away. These notes are an attempt to approach the subject from the nonexpert point of view: Not knowing anything (except rumours, maybe) about a subject to start with, what would I like to know first of all? My answer would be: 1) In what situations does the subject arise? 2) What are its essential features? 3) What are the applications and the connections to other fields? I would not be so interested in the proof of the most general case, but rather in an easier proof of a special case, which may give just as much of the basic idea in the argument. And I would be willing to believe some basic results without proof (at first stage, anyway) in order to have time for some more basic applications. These notes reflect this point of view. Such an approach enables us to reach the highlights of the theory quicker and easier. Thus it is hoped that these notes may contribute to fill a gap in the existing literature. The course is meant to be an appetizer. If it succeeds in awaking further interest, the reader will have a large selection of excellent literature available for the study of the whole story. Some of this literature is listed at the back. xxvi xxviii In the introduction we state 6 problems where stochastic differential equations play an essential role in the solution. In Chapter II we introduce the basic mathematical notions needed for the mathematical model of some of these problems, leading to the concept of Ito integrals in Chapter III. In Chapter IV we develop the stochastic calculus (the Ito formula) and in Chapter V we use this to solve some stochastic differential equations, including the first two problems in the introduction. In Chapter VI we present a solution of the linear filtering problem (of which problem 3 is an example), using the stochastic calculus. Problem 4 is the Dirichlet problem. Although this is purely deterministic we outline in Chapters VII and VIII how the introduction of an associated Ito diffusion (i.e. solution of a stochastic differential equation) leads to a simple, intuitive and useful stochastic solution, which is the cornerstone of stochastic potential theory. Problem 5 is an optimal stopping problem. In Chapter IX we represent the state of a game at time t by an Ito diffusion and solve the corresponding optimal stopping problem. The solution involves potential theoretic notions, such as the generalized harmonic extension provided by the solution of the Dirichlet problem in Chapter VIII. Problem 6 is a stochastic version of F.P. Ramsey’s classical control problem from 1928. In Chapter X we formulate the general stochastic control problem in terms of stochastic differential equations, and we apply the results of Chapters VII and VIII to show that the problem can be reduced to solving the (deterministic) Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. As an illustration we solve a problem about optimal portfolio selection. After the course was first given in Edinburgh in 1982, revised and expanded versions were presented at Agder College, Kristiansand and University of Oslo. Every time about half of the audience have come from the applied section, the others being so-called “pure” mathematicians. This fruitful combination has created a broad variety of valuable comments, for which I am very grateful. I particularly wish to express my gratitude to K.K. Aase, L. Csink and A.M. Davie for many useful discussions. I wish to thank the Science and Engineering Research Council, U.K. and Norges Almenvitenskapelige Forskningsra  ̊d (NAVF), Norway for their financial support.

However, such methods independently estimate the solution at every point, and hence do not take advantage of the high spatial regularity of solutions to elliptic problems. We propose a fast caching strategy which first estimates solution values and derivatives at randomly sampled points along the boundary of the domain (or a local region of interest). These cached values then provide cheap, output-sensitive evaluation of the solution (or its gradient) at interior points, via a boundary integral formulation. Unlike classic boundary integral methods, our caching scheme introduces zero statistical bias and does not require a dense global solve. Moreover we can handle imperfect geometry (e.g., with self-intersections) and detailed boundary/source terms without repairing or resampling the boundary representation. Overall, our scheme is similar in spirit to \emph{virtual point light} methods from photorealistic rendering: it suppresses the typical salt-and-pepper noise characteristic of independent Monte Carlo estimates, while still retaining the many advantages of Monte Carlo solvers: progressive evaluation, trivial parallelization, geometric robustness, \etc{}\ We validate our approach using test problems from visual and geometric computing.","2023-02-23","2023-05-02 08:09:18","2024-02-09 14:47:49","2023-05-02 08:09:18","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2302.11825 [cs]","","C:\Users\isido\Zotero\storage\LX3BMITM\Miller e.a. - 2023 - Boundary Value Caching for Walk on Spheres.pdf","","monte carlo; PDE; walk on spheres; boundary value problems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2302.11825","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet for problems with complex geometry, practical grid-free methods have been largely limited to basic Dirichlet boundary conditions. This paper introduces the \emph{walk on stars (WoSt)} method, which solves linear elliptic PDEs with arbitrary mixed Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions. The key insight is that one can efficiently simulate reflecting Brownian motion (which models Neumann conditions) by replacing the balls used by WoS with \emph{star-shaped} domains; we identify such domains by locating the closest visible point on the geometric silhouette. Overall, WoSt retains many attractive features of other grid-free Monte Carlo methods, such as progressive evaluation, trivial parallel implementation, and logarithmic scaling relative to geometric complexity.","2023-02-23","2023-05-01 17:04:56","2024-02-09 14:48:04","2023-05-01 17:04:56","","","","","","","Walk on Stars","","","","","arXiv","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2302.11815 [cs]","","C:\Users\isido\Zotero\storage\36DKDXFD\2302.11815.pdf","","monte carlo; PDE; walk on spheres; rendering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2302.11815","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To resolve such a problem, one would perform some variance reduction techniques such as importance sampling, stratiﬁcation, or control variates.

"M9XFVFQK","book","2008","Poli︠a︡nin, A. D.; Manzhirov, A. V.","Handbook of integral equations","","978-1-58488-507-8","","","","Integral equations are encountered in various fields of science and numerous applications (in elasticity, plasticity, heat and mass transfer, oscillation theory, fluid dynamics, filtration theory, electrostatics, electrodynamics, biomechanics, game theory, control, queuing theory, electrical engineering, economics, medicine, etc.). Exact (closed-form) solutions of integral equations play an important role in the proper understanding of qualitative features of many phenomena and processes in various areas of natural science. Lots of equations of physics, chemistry, and biology contain functions or parameters which are obtained from experiments and hence are not strictly fixed. Therefore, it is expedient to choose the structure of these functions so that it would be easier to analyze and solve the equation. As a possible selection criterion, one may adopt the requirement that the model integral equation admits a solution in a closed form. Exact solutions can be used to verify the consistency and estimate errors of various numerical, asymptotic, and approximate methods. More than 2,100 integral equations and their solutions are given in the first part of the book (Chapters 1–6). A lot of new exact solutions to linear and nonlinear equations are included. Special attention is paid to equations of general form, which depend on arbitrary functions. The other equations contain one or more free parameters (the book actually deals with families of integral xxx xxxii PREFACE equations); it is the reader’s option to fix these parameters. In total, the number of equations described in this handbook is an order of magnitude greater than in any other book currently available. The second part of the book (Chapters 7–14) presents exact, approximate analytical, and numerical methods for solving linear and nonlinear integral equations. Apart from the classical methods, some new methods are also described. When selecting the material, the authors have given a pronounced preference to practical aspects of the matter; that is, to methods that allow effectively “constructing” the solution. For the reader’s better understanding of the methods, each section is supplied with examples of specific equations. Some sections may be used by lecturers of colleges and universities as a basis for courses on integral equations and mathematical physics equations for graduate and postgraduate students. For the convenience of a wide audience with different mathematical backgrounds, the authors tried to do their best, wherever possible, to avoid special terminology. Therefore, some of the methods are outlined in a schematic and somewhat simplified manner, with necessary references made to books where these methods are considered in more detail. For some nonlinear equations, only solutions of the simplest form are given. The book does not cover two-, three-, and multidimensional integral equations. The handbook consists of chapters, sections, and subsections. Equations and formulas are numbered separately in each section. The equations within a section are arranged in increasing order of complexity. The extensive table of contents provides rapid access to the desired equations. For the reader’s convenience, the main material is followed by a number of supplements, where some properties of elementary and special functions are described, tables of indefinite and definite integrals are given, as well as tables of Laplace, Mellin, and other transforms, which are used in the book. The first and second parts of the book, just as many sections, were written so that they could be read independently from each other. This allows the reader to quickly get to the heart of the matter. We would like to express our deep gratitude to Rolf Sulanke and Alexei Zhurov for fruitful discussions and valuable remarks. We also appreciate the help of Vladimir Nazaikinskii and Alexander Shtern in translating the second part of this book, and are thankful to Inna Shingareva for her assistance in preparing the camera-ready copy of the book. The authors hope that the handbook will prove helpful for a wide audience of researchers, college and university teachers, engineers, and students in various fields of mathematics, mechanics, physics, chemistry, biology, economics, and engineering sciences.","2008","2023-03-26 12:07:56","2024-02-07 20:19:44","","","1108","","","","","","Handbooks of mathematical equations","","","","Chapman & Hall/CRC","Boca Raton","en","","","","","Library of Congress ISBN","QA431 .P65 2008","OCLC: ocn167516078","","C:\Users\isido\Zotero\storage\83JNUZ6J\Poli︠a︡nin en Manzhirov - 2008 - Handbook of integral equations.pdf","","integral equations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2nd ed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

WoB is a grid-free Monte Carlo solver for certain classes of second order partial differential equations. A similar Monte Carlo solver, the walk-on-spheres (WoS) method, has been recently popularized in computer graphics due to its advantages over traditional spatial discretization-based alternatives. We show that WoB’s intrinsic properties yield further advantages beyond those of WoS. Unlike WoS, WoB naturally supports various boundary conditions (Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin, and mixed) for both interior and exterior domains. WoB builds upon boundary integral formulations, and it is mathematically more similar to light transport simulation in rendering than the random walk formulation of WoS. This similarity between WoB and rendering allows us to implement WoB on top of Monte Carlo ray tracing, and to incorporate advanced rendering techniques (e.g., bidirectional estimators with multiple importance sampling, the virtual point lights method, and Markov chain Monte Carlo) into WoB. WoB does not suffer from the intrinsic bias of WoS near the boundary and can estimate solutions precisely on the boundary. Our numerical results highlight the advantages of WoB over WoS as an attractive alternative to solve boundary value problems based on Monte Carlo.

In particular, we implement this method on the GPU using CUDA, and investigate more viable methods of estimating the source integral when solving Poisson’s equation with intricate source terms. This is the case for a large group of gradient-domain methods in computer graphics, where source terms are represented by discrete volumetric data on regular grids. We develop unbiased source integral estimators like image-based importance sampling (IBIS) and biased estimators like source integral caching (SIC), and evaluate these against existing GPU-accelerated finite difference solvers for gradient-domain applications. By decoupling the source integration step from the WoS-algorithm, we find that the SIC method can improve performance by several orders of magnitude, making it competitive with existing finite difference solvers in many cases. We further investigate the viability of distance fields for accelerated distance queries, and find that these can provide significant performance improvements compared to BVHs without meaningfully affecting bias.","","2023-06-08 07:22:07","2023-08-03 19:18:46","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\isido\Zotero\storage\M3CIZFYI\Mossberg - GPU-Accelerated Monte Carlo Geometry Processing fo.pdf","","boundary value problems; monte carlo; PDE; walk on spheres","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One such challenge is the efficient estimation of the gradients of the volume's appearance with respect to its scattering and absorption parameters. We show that the straightforward approach---differentiating a volumetric free-flight sampler---can lead to biased and high-variance gradients, hindering optimization.

The generalized ray retains the defining characteristics of the ray-optical ray: locality and linearity. These properties allow the generalized ray to serve as a “point query” of light’s behaviour—the same purpose that the classical ray fulfils in rendering. By using such generalized rays, we enable the rendering of complex scenes, like the one shown, under rigorous wave-optical light transport. Materials admitting diffractive optical phenomena are visible: (a) a Bornite ore with a layer of copper oxide causing interference; (b) a Brazilian Rainbow Boa, whose scales are biological diffraction grated surfaces; and (c) a Chrysomelidae beetle, whose colour arises due to naturally-occurring multilayered interference reflectors in its elytron. Our formalism serves as a link between path tracing techniques and wave optics, and admits a highly general validity domain. Therefore, we are able to apply sophisticated sampling techniques, and achieve performance that surpasses the state-of-the-art by orders-of-magnitude.

One tension that has always faced these methods is the trade-off between preservation of global structure and preservation of local structure: these methods can either handle one or the other, but not both. In this work, our main goal is to understand what aspects of DR methods are important for preserving both local and global structure: it is difficult to design a better method without a true understanding of the choices we make in our algorithms and their empirical impact on the lower-dimensional embeddings they produce. Towards the goal of local structure preservation, we provide several useful design principles for DR loss functions based on our new understanding of the mechanisms behind successful DR methods. Towards the goal of global structure preservation, our analysis illuminates that the choice of which components to preserve is important. We leverage these insights to design a new algorithm for DR, called Pairwise Controlled Manifold Approximation Projection (PaCMAP), which preserves both local and global structure. Our work provides several unexpected insights into what design choices both to make and avoid when constructing DR algorithms.","2021-08-24","2023-07-23 10:26:53","2024-02-08 16:05:51","2023-07-23 10:26:53","","","","","","","Understanding How Dimension Reduction Tools Work","","","","","arXiv","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2012.04456 [cs, stat]","","C:\Users\isido\Zotero\storage\TW5ZFTXU\2012.04456.pdf","","machine learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2012.04456","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While WoS is efficient for computing a solution value at a single evaluation point, it becomes less efficient when the solution is required over a whole domain or a region of interest. WoS computes a solution for each evaluation point separately, possibly recomputing similar sub-walks multiple times over multiple evaluation points. In this paper, we introduce a novel filtering and caching strategy that leverages the volume mean value property (in contrast to the boundary mean value property that forms the core of WoS). In addition, to improve quality under sparse cache regimes, we describe a weighted mean as well as a non-uniform sampling method. Finally, we show that we can reduce the variance within the cache by recursively applying the volume mean value property on the cached elements.","2023","2023-08-01 08:39:05","2024-02-09 14:46:59","2023-08-01 08:39:05","10 pages","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","","","","DOI.org (Datacite)","","Artwork Size: 10 pages Publisher: The Eurographics Association","","C:\Users\isido\Zotero\storage\VT2WT79A\Bakbouk en Peers - 2023 - Mean Value Caching for Walk on Spheres.pdf","","monte carlo; PDE; walk on spheres","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"YEA9GPBH","journalArticle","","Granovskii, L","The Monte Carlo method","","","","","","Today, the Monte Carlo method has great applied value. On the other hand, it is possible to assert that it is the source of interesting and difficult mathematical problems. The first successes in using electronic computers engendered, outside and within the Soviet Union, unjustified (as subsequently became clear) confidence that the increased power of the computer permits, with help of the Monte Carlo method, the solution of practically any problem, with no heed given to the development of the method. When it turned out that this was not the case, interest in the Monte Carlo method began to slacken, but there then began to appear theoretical works from which it followed that an unthinking utilization of the method as a universal panacea could only wreak harm on its results. In addition, the use of means for taking a priori information into account, thus enriching the method, and the careful processing of algorithms and programs, usually make it possible to solve, in acceptable quantities of machine time, the unique multidimensional problems for which it would be unsafe to utilize other computational methods. Today, the Monte Carlo method is vigorously developed, and one can say that the foundations of its theory have all been laid. It should immediately be said that the Monte Carlo method has been defined as a method for simulating random variables and processes, with the goal of estimating parameters, representing solutions of problems of interest to us. The subject matter of the present survey is comprised of the results in the areas of theory and applications of the Monte Carlo method, all obtained over the period from the end of 1968 through 1974, inclusive, although, in individual cases, we mention even earlier work. An exception is the section ""Monte Carlo method and computational mathematics~ which dontains a survey of works over the last 10 years since, in this area, it is difficult to isolate the results of the last five years only. The volume of this survey does not permit, unfortunately, the consideration of certain fundamental works which preceded 1965. The reader can familiarize himself with such works by using various monographs [79 184, and others].","","2023-08-19 09:17:29","2023-08-20 07:18:20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\isido\Zotero\storage\MZDRJ4TW\Granovskii - The Monte Carlo method.pdf","","integral equations; integration; monte carlo; nonlinear systems; PDE; walk on spheres","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The algorithm is inherently parallel, since it is based on Monte Carlo simulations, and does not suﬀer from the numerical dispersion and dissipation issues that arise in ﬁnite diﬀerencebased numerical schemes on a lossy medium. This allowed us to develop an eﬃcient numerical method, capable of outperforming the classical FDTD method for large scale problems and high frequency signals.","2016-01","2023-09-09 08:11:32","2024-02-08 19:11:32","2023-09-09 08:11:32","29-43","","","305","","Journal of Computational Physics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\isido\Zotero\storage\7A7CJ95A\Acebrón en Ribeiro - 2016 - A Monte Carlo method for solving the one-dimension.pdf","","monte carlo; PDE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, they suffer from linear artifacts that show as failures in linearity-related statistical tests such as the binary-rank and the linear-complexity test. In this paper, we give two new contributions. First, we introduce two new $\mathbf F_2$-linear transformations that have been handcrafted to have good statistical properties and at the same time to be programmable very efficiently on superscalar processors, or even directly in hardware. Then, we describe some scramblers, that is, nonlinear functions applied to the state array that reduce or delete the linear artifacts, and propose combinations of linear transformations and scramblers that give extremely fast pseudorandom number generators of high quality. A novelty in our approach is that we use ideas from the theory of filtered linear-feedback shift registers to prove some properties of our scramblers, rather than relying purely on heuristics. In the end, we provide simple, extremely fast generators that use a few hundred bits of memory, have provable properties, and pass strong statistical tests.","2022-03-28","2023-11-21 18:32:13","2024-02-08 19:18:57","2023-11-21 18:32:13","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:1805.01407 [cs]","","C:\Users\isido\Zotero\storage\78AKGEN8\Blackman en Vigna - 2022 - Scrambled Linear Pseudorandom Number Generators.pdf","","random number generator","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:1805.01407","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition to serving as a broad and comprehensive study of numerical methods for initial value problems, this book contains a special emphasis on Runge-Kutta methods by the mathematician who transformed the subject into its modern form dating from his classic 1963 and 1972 papers. A second feature is general linear methods which have now matured and grown from being a framework for a unified theory of a wide range of diverse numerical schemes to a source of new and practical algorithms in their own right. As the founder of general linear method research, John Butcher has been a leading contributor to its development; his special role is reflected in the text. The book is written in the lucid style characteristic of the author, and combines enlightening explanations with rigorous and precise analysis. In addition to these anticipated features, the book breaks new ground by including the latest results on the highly efficient G-symplectic methods which compete strongly with the well-known symplectic Runge-Kutta methods for long-term integration of conservative mechanical systems. This third edition of Numerical Methods for Ordinary Differential Equations will serve as a key text for senior undergraduate and graduate courses in numerical analysis, and is an essential resource for research workers in applied mathematics, physics and engineering.","2003","2023-11-29 14:44:18","2024-02-09 19:41:00","","","425","","","","","","","","","","J.

We will focus mainly on elliptic PDEs, i.e., the Laplace and Poisson equations describing equilibrium states. Moreover, the applications that motivate us will mainly come from microelectronic integrated circuit. The Monte Carlo method in the Russian literature is often referred to (in translation) as “the method of statistical sampling.” This phrase has much more meaning than “the Monte Carlo method,” which was chosen due to the famous casino in Monte Carlo. Monte Carlo can be used to solve a variety of problems, and is the basis of the areas of stochastic ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and PDEs, and uncertainty quantification. In this book, we focus on the Monte Carlo method for solving partial differential and integral equations based on random walks. The random walk method essentially involves the Markov process. Historically it is most interesting to realize that there are certain application areas where Monte Carlo has become the dominant numerical method. One such area is in financial computations. Another is a topic in this book, the title of which is Monte Carlo Methods for Partial Differential Equations With Applications to Electronic Design Automation. Electronic Design Automation (EDA) is the process of designing microelectronic circuits. It is a key technology in an enormously important component of modern information technology. When one has a putative circuit design, before it can be processed for fabrication various validation computations are done to make sure that the design is not flawed. One such computation is based on electrostatics and insures that electronic crosstalk or even more catastrophically, electric arching does not make the device malfunction. The various physical components of the circuit, especially interconnect wires, have their mutual (coupling) capacitances which must be computed. This process is known as capacitance extraction or capacitance calculation, and is a common computation in electrostatics. Since the equations of electrostatics are the Laplace or Poisson equations, methods for the solution of elliptic PDEs are employed. For many years, deterministic techniques were employed in capacitance extraction. However, it was noticed that computing capacitance via vi Preface Monte Carlo methods was a very rapid technique. Eventually, the commercial codes for capacitance extraction began replacing deterministic with Monte Carlo methods. This book is meant to give the reader the background and state-of-the-art computational knowledge to understand and use Monte Carlo methods for capacitance calculation problems in particular, and more generally for the solution of elliptic PDEs in EDA. The work presented in this book are mostly from research projects undertaken by the Numbda group led by Wenjian Yu at the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, China. All chapters except Chap. 3 are composed/edited by Wenjian Yu. Chapter 3 is from the collaborative work with Michael Mascagni of Florida State University and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). It is interesting to note that this chapter deals with a Monte Carlo methods for the telegrapher’s equation, which is a hyperbolic PDE and definitely not describing an equilibrium problem. Most content of this book is based on the original publications shared at https://numbda.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/paper.html. We want to emphasize that the book is by no means intended to be comprehensive. The absence of coverage of related work should by no means diminish their value and contribution. Many academic or industrial experts have made significant contributions in the field, and the reader is encouraged to investigate their work.

In this paper we consider the diffusive scaling. Classical particle-based techniques suffer from a strict time-step restriction in this limit, to maintain stability. Asymptotic-preserving schemes avoid this problem, but introduce an additional time discretization error, possibly resulting in an unacceptably large bias for larger time steps. Here, we present and analyze a multilevel Monte Carlo scheme that reduces this bias by combining estimates using a hierarchy of different time step sizes. We demonstrate how to correlate trajectories from this scheme, using different time steps. We also present a strategy for selecting the levels in the multilevel scheme.

The algorithms are based on tracking the trajectories of the diffusing particles exactly in accordance with the probabilistic distributions derived from the explicit representation of the relevant Green functions for a sphere and a parallelepiped. They can be conveniently used not only for the solutions, but also for a direct calculation of fluxes to any part of the boundary without calculating the whole solution in the domain. Applications to exciton transport in semiconductors and related cathodoluminescence imaging of a set of randomly distributed threading dislocations are presented.","2020-07","2024-01-10 06:50:16","2024-02-09 14:46:45","2024-01-10 06:50:16","103065","","","61","","Probabilistic Engineering Mechanics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\isido\Zotero\storage\I8H6KY4Y\Sabelfeld - 2020 - Mesh-free stochastic algorithms for systems of dri.pdf","","monte carlo; PDE; walk on spheres","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Under a diffusive scaling, these combined effects converge to a diffusion equation for the position density in the limit of an infinite collision rate. Despite this well-defined limit, numerical simulation is expensive when the collision rate is high but finite, as small time steps are then required. In this work, we present an asymptotic-preserving multilevel Monte Carlo particle scheme that makes use of this diffusive limit to accelerate computations. In this scheme, we first sample the diffusive limiting model to compute a biased initial estimate of a Quantity of Interest, using large time steps. We then perform a limited number of finer simulations with transport and collision dynamics to correct the bias. The efficiency of the multilevel method depends on being able to perform correlated simulations of particles on a hierarchy of discretization levels. We present a method for correlating particle trajectories and present both an analysis and numerical experiments. We demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the cost of particle simulations in high-collisional regimes, compared with prior work, indicating significant potential for adopting these schemes in various areas of active research.","2023-08-31","2024-01-08 14:04:45","2024-02-08 19:31:08","2024-01-08 14:04:45","A1862-A1889","","4","45","","SIAM J.

Typical applications of PBDR repeatedly render a scene as part of an optimization loop involving gradient descent. The actual change introduced by each gradient descent step is often relatively small, causing a significant degree of redundancy in this computation. We exploit this redundancy by formulating a gradient estimator that employs a               recursive control variate               , which leverages information from previous optimization steps. The control variate reduces variance in gradients, and, perhaps more importantly, alleviates issues that arise from differentiating loss functions with respect to noisy inputs, a common cause of drift to bad local minima or divergent optimizations. We experimentally evaluate our approach on a variety of path-traced scenes containing surfaces and volumes and observe that primal rendering efficiency improves by a factor of up to 10.","2023-08","2024-01-07 09:59:48","2024-02-08 19:30:48","2024-01-07 09:59:48","1-13","","4","42","","ACM Trans.

Recently, it has also been proposed in the scientiﬁc literature to reformulate high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) as stochastic learning problems and to employ DNNs together with stochastic gradient descent methods to approximate the solutions of such high-dimensional PDEs. There are also a few mathematical convergence results in the scientiﬁc literature which show that DNNs can approximate solutions of certain PDEs without the curse of dimensionality in the sense that the number of real parameters employed to describe the DNN grows at most polynomially both in the PDE dimension d ∈ N and the reciprocal of the prescribed approximation accuracy ε > 0. One key argument in most of these results is, ﬁrst, to employ a Monte Carlo approximation scheme which can approximate the solution of the PDE under consideration at a ﬁxed space-time point without the curse of dimensionality and, thereafter, to prove then that DNNs are ﬂexible enough to mimic the behaviour of the employed approximation scheme. Having this in mind, one could aim for a general abstract result which shows under suitable assumptions that if a certain function can be approximated by any kind of (Monte Carlo) approximation scheme without the curse of dimensionality, then the function can also be approximated with DNNs without the curse of dimensionality. It is a subject of this article to make a ﬁrst step towards this direction. In particular, the main result of this paper, roughly speaking, shows that if a function can be approximated by means of some suitable discrete approximation scheme without the curse of dimensionality and if there exist DNNs which satisfy certain regularity properties and which approximate this discrete approximation scheme without the curse of dimensionality, then the function itself can also be approximated with DNNs without the curse of dimensionality. Moreover, for the number of real parameters used to describe such approximating DNNs we provide an explicit upper bound for the optimal exponent of the dimension d ∈ N of the function under consideration as well as an explicit lower bound for the optimal exponent of the prescribed approximation accuracy ε > 0. As an application of this result we derive that solutions of suitable Kolmogorov PDEs can be approximated with DNNs without the curse of dimensionality.","2022-08","2024-01-18 13:14:02","2024-02-08 19:34:47","2024-01-18 13:14:02","45","","4","3","","Partial Differ.

The GRWS algorithm is able to find the solution and derivative fields in any family of points simultaneously, using only one ensemble of random walks which drastically decreases the computer time compared to the standard random walk-based methods. The method in its nature is stochastic and meshless; the cost is of the order |log(ε)|/ε2 independent of the space dimension and complexity of the boundary shape, where ε is the desired accuracy. The variance, accuracy, and the cost of the method suggested are given. For illustration, we present simulation results for exciton drift-diffusion-recombination transport in a 3D prism and compare them with the exact solution.
